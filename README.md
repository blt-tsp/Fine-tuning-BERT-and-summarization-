#ShAP Implementation

this will create a summary plot showing the most important features (i.e., parts of the binary data) for the given test instance. 
You can also create other types of SHAP plots to explore the feature importance of your model.
Keep in mind that SHAP values are only meaningful in the context of a specific trained mode, 
so you will need to recompute them if you change the model or the input data. 
Additionally, SHAP values can be computationally expensive to compute, especially for large datasets or complex models, 
so you may need to be careful about how you use them in practice.

# Data Visualization
  Bar Chart of Encapsulated Protocols: 
     You can create a bar chart to show the number of instances of each encapsulated protocol in your dataset. 
     This will give your team an idea of the distribution of protocols in the data
     
 Distribution of SDH Frame Lengths: 
    You can create a histogram to show the distribution of SDH frame lengths in the dataset. 
    This will help your team understand the structure of the data.

  Heatmap of Correlation Matrix: 
    You can create a heatmap of the correlation matrix between the features in the dataset. 
    This will help your team understand the relationships between the different features and how they may impact the encapsulated protocol classification.

  PCA Scatterplot: 
    You can perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the data and create a scatterplot of the first two principal components. 
    This will help your team visualize the distribution of the data in two dimensions and identify any patterns or clusters.
    
  Confusion Matrix:
     After training your model, you can create a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model on the test set. 
     This will help your team understand which protocols are being misclassified and where the model can be improved.
